MAKE COMMANDS

Open a terminal within the MAJMAR folder with the makefile then use the following commands.

make tests: Compiles every test executable

make simulator: Compiles the top model executable

make clean: clears the bin and build folders

RUNNING TESTS

From the bin folder open a terminal and run the executable with a single number indicating which test you want to run. Currently, there are only 2 different tests each.

Example: ./FILTER_LOC_TEST 2

The MAIN executable does not have any inputs so it does not have tests available. It was tested by changing the number of helicopters and evacuees and observing its behaviour.
